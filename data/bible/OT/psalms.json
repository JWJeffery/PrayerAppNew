we will tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the Lord, and his might, and the wonders that he has done.\n78:5 He established a decree in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach to their children;\n78:6 that the next generation might know them, the children yet unborn, and rise up and tell them to their children,\n78:7 so that they should set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments;\n78:8 and that they should not be like their ancestors, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast, whose spirit was not faithful to God.\n78:9 The Ephraimites, armed with the bow, turned back on the day of battle.\n78:10 They did not keep God's covenant, but refused to walk according to his law.\n78:11 They forgot what he had done, and the miracles that he had shown them.\n78:12 In the sight of their ancestors he worked marvels in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.\n78:13 He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap.\n78:14 In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all night long with a fiery light.\n78:15 He split rocks open in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.\n78:16 He brought streams out of the rock, and caused water to flow down like rivers.\n78:17 Yet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert.\n78:18 They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved.\n78:19 They spoke against God, saying, 'Can God spread a table in the wilderness?\n78:20 Even though he struck the rock so that water gushed out and torrents overflowed, can he also give bread, or provide meat for his people?'\n78:21 Therefore, when the Lord heard, he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob, his anger mounted against Israel,\n78:22 because they had no faith in God, and did not trust his saving power.\n78:23 Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven;\n78:24 he rained down on them manna to eat, and gave them the grain of heaven.\n78:25 Mortals ate the bread of angels; he sent them food in abundance.\n78:26 He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he led out the south wind;\n78:27 he rained meat on them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the seas;\n78:28 he let them fall within their camp, all around their dwellings.\n78:29 And they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved.\n78:30 But before they had satisfied their craving, while the food was still in their mouths,\n78:31 the anger of God rose against them and he killed the strongest of them, and laid low the flower of Israel.\n78:32 In spite of all this they still sinned; they did not believe in his wonders.\n78:33 So he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in hasty terror.\n78:34 When he killed them, they sought for him; they repented and sought God earnestly.\n78:35 They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer.\n78:36 But they flattered them with their mouths;

often he restrained his anger, and did not stir up all his wrath.\n78:39 He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and does not come again.\n78:40 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert!\n78:41 They tested God again and again, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.\n78:42 They did not keep in mind his power, or the day when he redeemed them from the foe;\n78:43 when he displayed his signs in Egypt, and his miracles in the fields of Zoan.\n78:44 He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams.\n78:45 He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.\n78:46 He gave their crops to the caterpillar, and the fruit of their labor to the locust.\n78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost.\n78:48 He gave over their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to thunderbolts.\n78:49 He let loose on them his fierce anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels.\n78:50 He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.\n78:51 He struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the first issue of their strength in the tents of Ham.\n78:52 Then he led out his people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.\n78:53 He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.\n78:54 And he brought them to his holy hill, to the mountain that his right hand had won.\n78:55 He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.\n78:56 Yet they tested the Most High God, and rebelled against him. They did not observe his decrees,\n78:57 but turned away and were faithless like their ancestors; they twisted like a treacherous bow.\n78:58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their idols.\n78:59 When God heard, he was full of wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel.\n78:60 He abandoned his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among mortals,\n78:61 and delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe.\n78:62 He gave his people to the sword, and vented his wrath on his heritage.\n78:63 Fire devoured their young men, and their girls had no marriage song.\n78:64 Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.\n78:65 Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a warrior shouting because of wine.\n78:66 He put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting disgrace.\n78:67 He rejected the tent of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;\n78:68 but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.\n78:69 He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded forever.\n78:70 He chose his servant David, and took him from the sheepfolds;\n78:71 from tending the milch ewes he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of his inheritance Israel.\n78:72 With upright heart he tended them, and guided them with skillful hand.",
