Why do the peoples mutter empty threats?\n2:2 The kings of the earth rise up in revolt, and the princes plot together, against the Lord and against his Anointed.\n2:3 'Let us break their yoke,' they say; 'let us cast off their bonds from us.'\n2:4 He whose throne is in heaven is laughing; the Lord has them in derision.\n2:5 Then he speaks to them in his wrath, and his rage fills them with terror.\n2:6 'I myself have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.'\n2:7 Let me announce the decree of the Lord: he said to me, 'You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.\n2:8 Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for your inheritance and the ends of the earth for your possession.\n2:9 You shall crush them with an iron rod and shatter them like a piece of pottery.'\n2:10 And now, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth.\n2:11 Submit to the Lord with fear, and with trembling bow before him;\n2:12 Lest he be angry and you perish; for his wrath is quickly kindled.\n2:13 Happy are they all who take refuge in him!\n\n3:1 Lord, how many adversaries I have; how many there are who rise up against me.\n3:2 How many there are who say of me, 'There is no help for him in his God.'\n3:3 But you, O Lord, are a shield about me; you are my glory, the one who lifts up my head.\n3:4 I call aloud upon the Lord, and he answers me from his holy hill.\n3:5 I lie down and go to sleep; I wake again, because the Lord sustains me.\n3:6 I do not fear the multitudes of people who set themselves against me all around.\n3:7 Rise up, O Lord; set me free, O my God; surely you will strike all my enemies across the face, you will break the teeth of the wicked.\n3:8 Deliverance belongs to the Lord. Your blessing be upon your people!\n\n4:1 Answer me when I call, O God, defender of my cause; you set me free when I am hard-pressed; have mercy on me and hear my prayer.\n4:2 You mortals, how long will you dishonor my glory; how long will you worship dumb idols and run after false gods?\n4:3 Know that the Lord does wonders for the faithful; when I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.\n4:4 Tremble, then, and do not sin; speak to your heart in silence upon your bed.\n4:5 Offer the appointed sacrifices and put your trust in the Lord.\n4:6 Many are saying, 'Oh, that we might see better times!' Lift up the light of your countenance upon us, O Lord.\n4:7 You have put gladness in my heart, more than when grain and wine and oil increase.\n4:8 I lie down in peace; at once I fall asleep; for only you, Lord, make me dwell in safety.\n\n5:1 Give ear to my words, O Lord; consider my meditation.\n5:2 Hearken to my cry for help, my King and my God, for I make my prayer to you.\n5:3 In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice; early in the morning I make my appeal and watch for you.\n5:4 For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness, and evil cannot dwell with you.\n5:5 Braggarts cannot stand in your sight; you hate all those who work wickedness.\n5:6 You destroy those who speak lies; the bloodthirsty and deceitful, O Lord, you abhor.\n5:7 But as for me, through the greatness of your mercy, I will go into your house; I will bow down toward your holy temple in awe of you.\n5:8 Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness, because of those who lie in wait for me; make your way straight before me.\n5:9 For there is no truth in their mouth; there is destruction within them.\n5:10 Their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.\n5:11 Declare them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own devices.\n5:12 Because of their many transgressions cast them out, for they have rebelled against you.\n5:13 But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing out their joy with your loving care.\n5:14 Shake them that they may be joyful in you, those who love your Name.\n5:15 For you, O Lord, will bless the righteous; you will defend them with your favor as with a shield."
